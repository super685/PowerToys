## Installing and running Microsoft PowerToys

### Requirements

- Windows 10 v1903 (build 18362) or better preferred, Windows 10 v1803 (build 17134) minimum.  
- Have [.NET Core 3.1 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.11-windows-x64-installer). The installer should handle this but we want to directly make people aware.

### Via GitHub with EXE [Recommended]

#### Stable version

Install from the [Microsoft PowerToys GitHub releases page][github-release-link]. Click on `Assets` to show the files available in the release and then click on `PowerToysSetup-0.33.1-x64.exe` to download the PowerToys installer.

This is our preferred method.

#### Experimental version
To install the Video Conference mute, please use the [v0.28 pre-release experimental version of PowerToys][github-prerelease-link] to try out this version. It includes all improvements from v0.27 in addition to the Video conference utility. Click on `Assets` to show the files available in the release and then download the .exe installer.

We hope to have an updated version in February 2021 with the new DirectShow driver.

### Via WinGet (Preview)
Download PowerToys from [WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases). To install PowerToys, run the following command from the command line / PowerShell:

```powershell
WinGet install powertoys
```

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficialInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop.  If these are your preferred install solutions, this will have the install instructions.

## What's Happening

### PowerToys Roadmap

Our [prioritized roadmap][roadmap] of features and utilities that the core team is focusing on.

### 0.33 - February 2021 Update

Our goals for [v0.33 release cycle][github-release-link] was to add in some critical new functionality into the new user experience as well as a plug-in manager for PowerToys Run.  In addition, we feel we are near ready to add in Video Conference mute into the stable release pending feedback from the pending 0.34 experimental release.  The 0.34 experimental release will happen week of March 8th toward the end of the week pending testing.

Our [prioritized roadmap][roadmap] of features and utilities that the core team is focusing on for the near future. We fixed a lot of localization issues from our initial release but we may not still be perfect. If you find an issue, please file a [localization bug][loc-bug].

#### Highlights from v0.33 Stable/0.34 Experimental 

**General**
- Updated overview links to be language agnostic to the docs site.
- 'First time load' experience.  The hope is a quick, light way to learn about basic functionality.  We have some more work to do and want to also use the same framework for teaching about updates as well.
- Localization corrections

**FancyZones**
- Adjusted editor UX based on feedback.  Thanks [@niels9001](https://github.com/niels9001)!
- New options to change zone activation algorithm.

**File Explorer**
- Improved how SVG images are previewed in the preview pane, thanks[@Drakula44](https://github.com/Drakula44)!
- [@Aaron-Junker](Aaron-Junker) has created a proof of concept for using [Monaco editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) for previewing dev files.  This will enable over 125+ file types.

**PowerToys Run**
- Plugin Manager now is in settings.  You can directly turn on / off, include items in general search, and change the action key!  Thanks [@htcfreek](https://github.com/htcfreek) for the great feedback!
- Improved support for additional window managers by abstracting out shell process calls. Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)!
- Fix for PT Run registering the hotkey on non-supported OS versions.
- `~` will now act as the user home directory in Folder plugin.  Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)
- Service plugin has adjusted status messages

**Video Conference Mute (Experimental)**
- Adjust video muting to leverage DirectShow.
- Goal is to have 0.34 experimental release week of March 8th.

**Settings**
- When restarting as admin, the settings now will reopen. Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)!

**ARM64 Progress**
- Investigation on how we'll accomplish Settings with the XAML Island and WPF app.
